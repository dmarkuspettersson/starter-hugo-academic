I am a macroeconomist and a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Economics at Stockholm University. I hold a PhD in economics from the Stockholm School of Economics.

My research focuses on how heterogeneity at the household level interacts with outcomes at the macroeconomic level. My current work investigates how changes in the cost of living differ across households with different consumption patterns (and how to measure these) and the impact of demographic change on economic growth and output per capita.
