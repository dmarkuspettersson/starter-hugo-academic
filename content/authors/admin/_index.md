I am a macroeconomist and a fifth-year doctoral candidate at the Stockholm School of Economics.

My research focuses on the interactions between heterogeneity at the household level and macroeconomic outcomes. My current work investigates how changes in the cost of living differ across households with different consumption patterns (and how to measure these) and the impact of demographic change on economic growth and output per capita.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained a master's degree in economics from the Stockholm School of Economics and undergraduate degrees in mathematics from Stockholm University and in economics from University College London.
